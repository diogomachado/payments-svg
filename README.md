# payments-svg

How often do you need a logo of these in good quality and can not find it? I've had the job of vectorizing all of these, and make it available here for you.

## How use

Copy `sprite.css` and `sprite.svg` in your project, link:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/sprite.css" />
```

## Customize

All svg source files are in the source folder
